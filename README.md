# bob

Bob the builder (yes I know, I currently already have a project called this - the old project will be completely merged into the aquarium system, and this one will be the "definitive" bob).
Buildsystem for the AQUA ecosystem.

## Installation

If you don't already have Bob on your system, you can bootstrap it as such:

```console
sh build.sh
```

Then, you can install it to your system with:

```console
sh-bin/bob install
```

## Features

- [x] Written in C and with a very basic project structure, so can easily be bootstrapped.
- [x] Automatically installs (certain) dependencies.
- [x] Uses [Wren](https://wren.io/) as a dynamic configuration language because regular configuration files sucks.
- [x] Centralised system for building, testing, and installing.
- [ ] Works with AQUA, i.e. AQUA projects may be built and run just as easily as any other project using Bob.
- [ ] Easy method for building out a project skeleton from a template (serves the same purpose as [`aqua-manager`](https://github.com/inobulles/aqua-manager) did).
- [ ] Packaging (AQUA ZPK & FreeBSD PKG formats).
- [ ] Understands other popular buildsystems (simple makefile, cmake, autoconf, qmake, setup.py, &c) to eliminate tmw you have to google stuff when you just want something to compile ðŸ¤ª
- [ ] Watch source files to automatically rebuild them.
- [ ] Can build in sandboxes (local CI in background truly continuously by watching source files instead of just on commits? integration with other CI providers, e.g. with Cirrus CI by Automatically generating `.cirrus.yml`?).

## Personal notes

Disregard these, these are personal notes for development.

- wren is okay with `wrenGetListCount` on a `*Sequence`, which happens because `IS_LIST` on a sequence value returns true (it shouldn't right? because that breaks things when doing `AS_LIST` on it to get a `ValueBuffer` afterwards...)
- the same problem as above seems to happen with foreign type slots
